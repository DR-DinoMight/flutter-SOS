        Layouts feel very much like flex box, Coloumns expand on the height (Y Axis)
        and Rows ( X Axis).

        Flutter - Widget Center Class
        will be as big as possible (parent container aviable space).unless a width and height are specified

        Main Axis - is dependent on the widget - if using rows its x Axis or column Y axis.

        Timer - look at https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Timer/Timer.periodic.html
